        <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Steve Job's Life's life:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1955</strong> - Steve Jobs was born on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco, to parents Joanne Simpson 
            and Abdulfattah Jandali. He was later adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs with whom he moved to Mountain View, California.
            <br>
            As a child, Jobs was interested in engineering and electronics and took apart various items to see how they worked. 
            He later attended Homestead High School in Cupertino, California.
            </li>
            <li><strong>1968</strong> - As a continuation of his interest in electronics, Steve Jobs called up Bill Hewlett, 
                the co-founder of Hewlett-Packard, in search of spare parts to build a frequency counter. Impressed by Jobs’ 
                attention to detail, he was granted the parts as well as an internship for the summer.
            </li>
            <li><strong>1970 - 1972</strong> - In the early part of 1970, Jobs’ meets the future Apple co-founder, Steve Wozniak, 
                through a mutual friend and the two get along quite well despite their four-year age difference.
                <br>
                In 1972, Jobs enrolled at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. However, he dropped out after one semester as he 
                felt that he was not getting anything out of it. Although, Steve Jobs did continue auditing calligraphy classes at 
                Reed College which kept him interested.
            </li>
            <li><strong>1974</strong> - Steve Jobs then returned to California and began a brief stint as a technician at Atari, 
                a video game manufacturer. While here, Jobs’ gets in touch with Wozniak and enlists his help in deciding on the 
                hardware required for the prototype for a single-player game called Pong, which would later be known as Breakout.
                <br>
                In the summer of 1974, Jobs traveled to India with a friend to visit ashrams and experience Buddhism. Upon his 
                return to the US, he began attending meetings of the Homebrew Computer Club with Steve Wozniak.
            </li>
            <li><strong>1976</strong> - Wozniak had designed and built his own computer-cum-logic board which he called the Apple 
                I. With Jobs’ help, they founded Apple Computer (now Apple Inc.) in 1976 and released their first product, the Apple 
                I, later that year.
                <br>
                Apple’s third founder, Ronald Wayne, served as the group’s adult supervisor, drawing up the Apple logo, the 
                partnership agreement, and the manual for Apple I. Afraid of the financial risks, Ronald Wayne gave up his shares 
                for a sum of $2,300 but the Apple I went on to sell for $666.66 a piece by the end of the year.
            </li>
            <li><strong>1977</strong> - On January 3, 1977, Apple gets incorporated as an official company , supported by a group 
                of venture capitalists. The company’s second product, the Apple II, plastic encased with color graphics, was released 
                in 1977 and became one of the first commercially successful personal computers. Sales naturally hit more than $1 Million

            <li><strong>1978</strong> - Steve Job gets blessed with a daughter named Lisa, with then-girlfriend Chrisann Brennan, 
                whom he initially denied paternity. Chrisann raises Lisa on welfare funds during which it takes time for Jobs’ to 
                acknowledge paternity towards his child. He would later name the Apple computer Lisa in his daughter’s name.
